# 🛠️ EZ Mocker ~ HTTP request interceptor

A lightweight, no-dependency Chrome extension that intercepts both `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` calls. It enables you to **mock API responses** with custom status codes, headers, delays, and full JSON bodies while your original request still reaches its destination.

> 🚀 Weighs only 100KB and uses chromium-based APIs.

## 🧾 License

MIT License. Free to use and modify. Limit interceptors to 5-12 request as i've seen across multiple extensions should be considered a crime so I built this out of spite. Take care y'all, until AGI replace us.
